"I read somewhere a line that said:’’ At the end of my suffering there was a door’’[1]. Well now it seems that my doors have no end, or the other way around, I could not tell from this point of view. But maybe you can decipher what the hell is wrong with me. Let me describe you one ordinary day in my life. I wake up two hours after noon, exhausted from sleeping and of sleep deprivation. What I have is not another case of insomnia, but yet another undiagnosed condition. I like to call it a medical condition just to justify my way of living. But, let’s move on. I get up almost every day with a great hunger so I walk in my pajamas across the living room and enter the kitchen. I approach the refrigerator and grab its cold, white, plastic handle. I open the refrigerator and look around. As my eyes roam from the turkey salami to hot sauce flavored chicken paste I can feel the disgust and nausea rising from my stomach. It’s been just five hours since my last post-midnight snack and three rolled cigarettes. My stomach aches just at the sight of any kind of food. I say goodbye to the refrigerator and close its door silently so that no one notices that I’m up.

I walk up the six stairs in my house that lead to the bathroom. With the screeching sound of the door I enter a thoroughly lit bathroom that smells of lavender air freshener. I feel nauseated again. Not by the smell of the air freshener but by the sight of my pale face etched on the bathroom mirror. I take my tooth brush and a little bit of tooth paste, and as I stare into my own pale face and sunken eyes, I try not to throw up while I brush my teeth. That is the first challenge every morning. I will be honest with you: I don’t have an eating disorder and I’m not a drug addict. I’m just unemployed. Which is, if I may say, the same shit as if I were one. Miserable.

I fill my hands with a pond of fresh and cold water. I splash my face and stare at it while the drops of clear water run down my face and land on my shirt. A sudden flash of good mood surprises me and gives me hope that I will eventually achieve to change this particular day. Not all days are the same. But the previous ones have been. I enter the living room and turn the TV on. I don’t like silence. I move on to see if my father has left me something special from the bakery. This morning he did. I jump around as a kid because I don’t have to prepare anything for breakfast. Or lunch. It depends on the time when you wake up. I eat my breakfast at nearly 3 p.m. I pour myself a big glass of whatever juice is around, grab my chocolate croissant and dive into my beige sofa. My teeth slowly taste the sweetness of chocolate and then the texture of the pastry. Yummy, I think to myself. I’m going to eat and then I’ll watch TV for a bit. Everyone watches TV, don’t you? I know you do. So I rush through all channels, remember when ‘’Ally McBeal’’ starts and enter my room. I clean the mess from last night, tidy my bed, open the window to let the smoke out and start rolling my first cigarette. With the first smoke I know that this day will not be any different than the other. Than yesterday. But towards the end of the cigarette I plot about a possible task of the day. Maybe I can go fetch some healthy, fresh water for all of us, maybe I could go visit my cousin’s wife and kids, maybe have a coffee, come back home, use the car for all that and clear my head for a while. I finish of my cigarette and I jump up and head into the lean hallway. I can see that nearly 15 plastic bottles are full of fresh water. That one is crossed out, I say to myself. What was the other thing? Oh, yes. I could go and visit my cousin, his wife and their children. I love children. I rush to my mobile phone. I quickly type in the letter R and there it is, the number of my cousin’s wife. First a dull telephone sound, then a pleasant voice speaks and greets me with kindness. I ask where she is, she says she’s not at home. She is currently helping her mom whitewash the walls. Kids are with her and D is working late. I answer that it doesn't matter and that I will visit them next time. Then I hold on to the thought that I could go and pick up my mom from work and maybe help her shopping, cause that could be good, just to help me raise my spirits a bit. I open my front door and call on to my father. He is not at home. Brother is at school, I know that. I call my father up to ask him where he is and he says he has a meeting and that he will pick up mom on his way home. I surrender.The clock strikes 4 p.m. ‘’Ally McBeal’’ starts and it’s that episode when she buys a mansion in order to get over Billy’s death. I plunge into my beige sofa and think about how many times have I watched this episode and cried like a little baby. That is what I’m going to do. Sit here, cry when something is emotional enough on the episode and wait for everyone to come home. I sit and watch until I hear my mother’s voice and the ruffling of the plastic bags. She went shopping for groceries. I greet her with a faint smile and ask how was her day. She says it’s too warm for this time of the year. I respond with a vague nod acknowledging that she is absolutely right. I grab the plastic bags and start looking at the groceries like a little child, searching for a chocolate hidden somewhere in between all other stuff. I put all that she bought in separate boxes in the kitchen, grab the chocolate bar and carry on watching ‘’Ally McBeal’’.I don’t have to cook today, we have pees from yesterday and mom has already made a salad to go with it. Although I’m not hungry, I start eating my ‘’lunch’’ and a feeling of fullness starts to invade my body. After lunch mom watches her favorite TV show, dad takes a nap, brother is still at school and I got to my room. I go on the internet. Facebook. Nothing new. No news about the salaries that they did not manage to pay in on time. Gmail. No e-mails. No answers to my motivational letters and job applications. I stare at a blank field on youtube.com. I don’t know which song suits my current mood. So I don’t listen to anything. I call my boyfriend up. He is working, he loves me, I love him. I miss him, he misses me. We end the call with a promise that he will call me when he comes home. I look around my room. It’s tidy. There are some clothes on my favorite, nightmare-terminator sofa, but it doesn't ruin the complete impression of the room. My closet is tidy. All my clothes are neatly folded. My make-up and fake jewelry is neatly stored in cute little boxes and bowls. Only thing that bothers me is the tobacco spilled all over my computer and the stained glass table.
A knock on the door. My mother asks me if I want the coffee here in my room or if I want to drink it with them. I know it’s 8 p.m. I say that I’m going to join them in the living room. As I enter the living room, my brother hugs me, shares a few words with me regarding school and runs to his room to play games on the computer. I try to drink my coffee and I also try to follow the conversation between my mom and dad. I say a few words; we exchange a few smiles or even comment on the level of stupidity that is handed to us every day via television. I stay there for an hour. I finish my coffee and go back to my room. I talk with my good friend on the internet. We talk for hours on skype and facebook. We basically give and take our daily doses of courage, optimism and reality. I soak that in and because I know that this is going to be yet another sleepless night I don’t notice the hours passing by. I notice that my mom came in to ask me whether I plan to go anywhere in the morning. My answer is almost always no. I also notice that my father turned off the TV and yelled a fatherly ‘’sleep tight’’ to me and my brother. I also notice that my brother comes in, asks how I’m doing, kisses me and wishes he could also stay with me long after midnight. I wish him a good night. All other things somehow get blurry. The hours, the words, the research, the unfinished novels, novellas, poems, the unemployment, the new season finale of ‘’The Vampire Diaries’’, another torture of watching a documentary about an ex-Yugoslav band, whose members are not here with us.My boyfriend calls me to say goodnight. He asks me when am I planning to go to sleep. I always say ‘’ In a minute’’ or ‘’ I will not stay much longer’’ and I wish him the sweetest possible dreams there are. Mine will not come this evening. I role a cigarette and finish it off staring at the brown alarm clock. It says: it’s half past four. I go to the bathroom. I wash my hands, clean my face, brush my teeth and clean all the ashtrays that I have left in the kitchen. I enter my room. Open the window to let the smoke out. I put on my pajamas and breathe in the fresh air. I close the window. I turn on my night lamp and lay in bed. That is where my suffering begins, because every day a door instead of a clock strikes 2 and wakes me up. All my days are the same and that is why at the end of this all I don’t see a door. I roll up one more cigarette, lit it up, while holding my stuffed white and blue colored bear close to me and I protest to all the nights that I didn't sleep on time and that I have spent awake, lonely, tired, exhausted, paranoid, scared and I say: I will not sleep tonight, but tomorrow I will make a door for myself and walk through it. I’ll put a sign on that particular door, and it will read: MY SUFFERING.",Negative,
"The violence didn’t start straight away, and it didn’t happen very often, but the psychological abuse was vast, and it left scars that will never fully heal. There is so much of what happened that I very purposely blocked out. This is one of many reasons why opening my memory box was so difficult. It forced me to remember just how bad it was and how deep the damage went.I had forgotten that he banned me from eating apples. It sounds odd, and it was, but it was about control. He isolated me from my friends. He damaged my relationship with my then boyfriend and was a key reason in my decision to ultimately ended our relationship. I was so deeply traumatised after what happened, I couldn’t bare for any part of my present to be a part of my future. I left my home town and very deliberately did not keep in touch with anyone from school. It was too painful. He damaged my relationship with my parents and brother, those relationships thankfully healed with time and are now the strongest relationships I have outside of my husband.I couldn’t bear to be around anything that reminded me of Jim, even my home. I moved to Preston for university in 2008 and vowed I would rarely return home, and indeed I rarely did, although my parents visited a lot thankfully. I wanted a new town, where no-one knew me, and I could start over. There are two very distinct periods in my life, before Jim, and after Jim. No single person on this planet knows both of those people entirely. They know me as before Rachel or after Rachel. I even sheltered my parents from many details, for my benefit more than theirs. My Dad knows more than my Mum or Brother, because he sat in the police interviews with me, but no one will ever know it all. They don’t need to.In this article I will be sharing more than I have ever shared collectively before, but I will never share all of it. It is my story, and mine alone. There are somethings too painful to recall, and I had to heal by myself.Two friends stuck by me when it all came out, and actively helped keep me safe in school. I never thanked them properly, so I want to take a moment to thank Alice and Zoe now. Reading my records for the police back, I had forgotten how involved you were, and I am sorry I haven’t thanked you properly before now. Alice, you never left my side after I finally went to the police, you drove me to school, you missed lessons for me, you let me attend your classes that I wasn’t even studying so I’d feel safer. I would not have survived that year without you, and I am sorry it’s taken me twelve years to say thank you. ended the friendship in June of that year, but my story was far from over. One email will always haunt me. It detailed the MySpace incident and described me ending the friendship as emotional rejection and torture. He told me he’d done stupid things to cope. It talked about an occasion when I’d spoken to him again, after he had sucked me back in. How he thought we would be okay after that, but then I’d texted him ending our friendship. This text had followed a conversation with my mum. As I lay on my mum’s bed one night in 2006 she came in and asked me five simple words “are you afraid of Jim?”. I broke down, and finally told her what had been going on. She’d seen the change in me and had pieced things together. It was after that she took me to the doctor who diagnosed me with depression and I sent Jim that short text to explain we couldn’t be friends anymore. The email he sent me in response told me how angry he was with me, stating specifically how angry he was that I thought I could do that to him. He told me I could not do that to him and he wanted to talk to me in person. I owed him that. I’d gone back on all the promises I had made, and he was back where he started and he hated that. It ended with the words “You gotta face me sometime Rachel. You know you have to”.

Reading those final words gives me chills even now. I will never forget feeling sick with dread at what would come next. I knew he wouldn’t let this go and thus began months of watching over my shoulder, skipping school and being afraid to be alone even in my own home. My parents involved the school after this, but they did nothing. I believe in forgive and forget, but I will never forgive a handful of teachers for the ways they so bitterly let me down. They had a responsibility to keep me safe in school. I was being stalked and threatened. They chose to do nothing. I told them what he’d done, and they left me to survive alone. It almost cost me my future at university, and ultimately my life. I spiralled badly, I wasn’t eating, I was drinking in secret and I was self-harming.",Negative,
"n one entry she wrote: 'I try my best all the time but she only focuses on my mistakes.'The diary describes how she was sent to the cash machine to withdraw money but the card was swallowed.She was so terrified of returning home that she walked the streets of the Lancashire town where she lived for two hours.On returning home, she was whipped with a computer cable and denied an evening meal.Peter Wild, prosecuting, told Blackburn Magistrates court: 'When she eventually did go home she was whipped with a computer cable.'She remembers asking her mum for mercy. Her response was that a stupid child didn't deserve mercy, a stupid child deserved beating.'The girl wrote: 'She has hurt me to the point I can't take it any more. I have endured a lot of pain and suffering. I am covered in scars due to the wires and I have been roaming the streets.'When an MP3 player was taken away as a punishment she revealed: 'It is the only present I have had in seven years.'She also told how she was not allowed to go to a friend's birthday party: 'It was the first birthday party I was ever invited to. I felt so left out.'In another entry the girl described how she was forced to 'stool down' as a punishment, which involved bending over with one finger touching the floor while being beaten.During such a beating, she locked herself in the bathroom and called police. However the girl still defended her mother in the diary writing: 'My mum is not a bad person. She simply believes in the African way of thinking.'",Negative,

"With the three stages of the exam spread across a time span of one year, an IAS aspirant, apart from maintaining his motivation, also has to battle the constant queries of relatives regarding the dates of the exam and, more importantly, the result dates. After a lot of slogging, when the aspirant clears the first stage (prelims) in the very first attempt, the expectations sky-rocket, putting him under tremendous pressure.The pressure of the next stage (mains), in addition to the societal pressure, makes the going really tough. But unfortunately, nobody except the aspirant realises this. After he manages to clear the mains as well, the entire family and relatives erupt into grand celebrations, without realising that the final frontier (interview stage) is yet to be won.After giving their heart and soul, a handful of those who manage to crack all the three stages of the exam and end up with top ranks, become instant celebrities, with all the competitive magazines carrying their photos and interviews and hundreds of other aspirants thronging them to take some “marg darshan.”On the other hand, there are those aspirants who despite putting in their best efforts, miss the bus by a whisker. What makes life tough for them is when the society at large treats them as if a doctorate has failed in a class I exam.A little more compassion and tolerance on the part of society will make the going a lot easier for the IAS aspirants. A little more moral support will ensure that the country gets quality bureaucrats. Give us a hand and we will give it our best shot!",Negative,
I’ve been in the UPSC loop for 2 years now and I can tell you one thing you must know from Day 1 - “Don’t expect much. You’ll be devastated if you do”. UPSC is an expensive dream. It takes exorbitant hard work and endless patience just to keep this dream alive. UPSC preparation takes a lot from you and gives very less (till you ultimately clear it). You have to study and memorize “entire” subjects again and again and the question paper might still break your heart (brutally).It’s strange. When an aspirant starts preparing he/she is told by their teachers and mentors these things. Society will be harsh on you.You already knew this was in the offing but when it actually happens with you it’s still hurtful. You realize you’re not that carefree after all.,Negative,
"It's my second attempt. Been almost 1.5 years since i graduated. Always been a good student. But now , UPSC has shown me the ground reality .

There's a void, which is increasing day by day. Loneliness is at its peak. Nothing feels good at times. Even though there's a craving for people yet Too much human interaction gives headache.

Seeing ur batchmates getting selected in many exams, earning pretty decent amount of money , their travel pics, get together pics , further increase the self doubts.

But the moment u get back to ur senses , the moment u know why u r doing this , the moment u start focussing and studying again, all of the negativity fades away. Confidence boosts up. U feel powerful. U know that u r doing something right.

It seriously isn't about the selection. I know many of u would not take it seriously, but those preparing by heart knows , it's not about the selection but learning. One learns so much about own country, gets to see a side that one never ever thought existed .

"t's been an year now that upsc bug bit me..i always had it stored in my mind somewhere from 9th standard that one day i am gonna start preparing for this exam. So last year when in jammu and kashmir 4g internet was restored,i started inquiring more about the Getting selected has its own charm but hey, the journey is no exam ..In the starting day's when i read about the syallabus and 2 paper for prelims and then 9 papers for mains..i got a bit nervous and asked myself..okay am i ready finally? And YES was the answer i got from myself.

And then i immersed myself into the syllabus understanding and making a book list and all the stuff that is needed.

"When I failed my second prelims, just imagine my state. Broken to bits. However I had to get up with all my will and put in every ounce of energy I had in preparation. This involved a lot of hardwork. For 1.5 years, I had set my alarm clock: as sleep at 10:30 pm, get up at 6:00 am. Infact I still follow this timing because my body has been conditioned into this habit.

I worked hard like a donkey, whether it be making concise notes of every topic or writing numerous tests for both prelims and mains. I had become a machine when it came to revisions. I took care of my diet, eating healthy and avoiding junk as far as possible.

All I know is that if you dream, put in all resources you have to fulfill that dream. When I used to read about Anu Kumari or Pushp Lata, having kids and then preparing, I used to feel a sense of rebuke for myself. I had all kinds of support- financial, moral, family. I had 24hrs to prepare and still I was faltering.

"He kept on insisting that I should move to Delhi to kickstart my UPSC preparations and finally succeeded in convincing me to make the journey in October that year. He promised to take care of himself and his treatment and insisted that I shouldn’t worry too much and focus on my goal. I still vividly remember the day when he saw me off at Rishra railway station. I touched his feet. That was the last time.

I began settling in Delhi. Meanwhile, my dad’s condition steadily started deteriorating. He talked only once a week over phone, lest I get disturbed. And whenever he called, he only talked about my studies, my mock tests and nothing else. He always deflected questions on his health saying he was alright and even instructed my mother and sisters to not talk about it. So much so that even in his final days when he was asked whether I should be called back from Delhi, he vehemently opposed! I have never seen a man as brave as him. I will never see a sacrifice as big as this.

I was racing against all odds to clear UPSC sooner so that I could afford better treatment for him. I lost that race. It was May 31, 2015 when I was still in Vajiram that I got the call. My cousin informed that my father was no more.

It had affected my mental and physical health and I couldn’t give my best in the prelims in August that year. I failed. But I gathered myself again. I took inspiration from my father’s sacrifices and the reason for which he bore all the pain. Almost as a tribute the sacrifices of my father, on his 2nd death anniversary, on 31st May, 2017 the UPSC results were declared and I fulfilled his dream. However, the fact that he would never know it and he was not there to celebrate this, will haunt me forever.

"1 years ago I was an abusive piece of shit. I fell in love with a girl named Sara, it started out great, but I was not a good man in those days and I put her through hell. I was afraid of losing her, afraid of opening up to her, afraid of the world, afraid of people, afraid of everything. I was a fucking cowardly son of a bitch and my fear of losing her and my fear of everything I couldn't control led me to controlling her. I lacked confidence, I had no self esteem, and I was was damned if I was going to let her go.. and I hurt her many times, and that woman suffered through my bullshit temper tantrums and bullshit contradictory behavior for three years before you finally gave up on the hope that I would ever change. I was such a coward and a fucking idiot that I remember after the break up I really couldnt understand why she left me. I even had the audacity to confront her about it a few months after she left me and I watched as this girl broke down, told me how much she really loved me, told me what a good person I was when I wasn't knocking her down, or hitting her and how that side of me is what kept her from leaving. She went into very great detail about all of the rotton, mean, abusive and cowardly things I had done to her. I saw the pain in her eyes for the first time, that horrible pain... That pain that I put her through. That I caused. I felt it right through my fucking soul and for months and months after that I had terrible nightmares, I would wake up crying as if she had just left me all over again and you know what... I deserved every fucking second of those nightmares and those painful feelings. I deserved so much worse than that. It changed me. I put myself through therapy and anger management.

In her mind, I am a horrible child/son and that is why she cut me out of her life. There is no conflict resolution or talking things out with her. It's her way or no way, even if her way is very hurtful, unfair, and cruel. It took me a long time to realize that my mother had some serious issues which contributed to her treating me the way she did. For a long time I thought I was to blame.

Seriously, what is it that you seem to hear every time someone asks a woman why they don’t leave him? “But, I love him.” Sound familiar? While the abusive men are a problem and we should not tolerate them, they bigger problem is the women with such low self esteem. Instead of sentencing the men to jail, Society and these women would probably be better off if we sentenced these women to counselling to deal with their self esteem issues. Not saying we should not punish the abusers, just saying if we have to choose between one or the other, helping the women would probably do more good than punishing the men. By the way, this also goes both ways. Men can use help too. probably more so. There are presently a ton of resources and agencies for abused women, but precious few for abused men.",Negative,

Now while old age still catches most of us unaware, as a young man I made a point of learning to recite this extract from the Tennyson poem 'Ulysses', in the hope that when my time came to be old that I too would also be able to shake my fist at the debilitators of 'time and fate' and speak the poet's words with the same conviction and determination:",Negative,
"Some merciless adults dump their old aged parents in old aged homes and never ever bother to come and see them later on. They don’t care even a bit about their responsibility towards them in old age. Today the society has become money mined. Everyone is hankering after money, power and fame. So in the given scenario, old aged people are considered a big economic liability. The old aged people fear loneliness all the time. They wish to see their loved ones around but alas no one is bothered whether they are alive or dead.

In fact, many old people, unable to bear this loneliness, commit suicide. Aging also hardens the likes and dislikes of a person—his or her prejudices, perceptions, and value judgments that refuse to acknowledge the reality of aging. Many people get extremely panicky when they become old. Old age people become depressed and feel lonely all the time. Life becomes a burden for them.

Old age — like youth and middle age, is both a curse and a blessing. They suffer from various diseases. No one cares for them. They suffer from diabetes, arthritis, body pains and various health ailments. They are financially dependent on their children for medical assistance. The children consider their health problems a major drain of their money. Attending a sick old age person is considered an intrusion in their independence and personal space.",Negative,
"I worked in an old age home. People go in there knowing they will die there.

They feel useless. There is no work or tasks for them to do. Nobody wants their help or advice.

They feel relieved that they are not a burden to their families and can be with others in the same boat. No more worry about how they are going to care for themselves.

They feel so lonesome. If they are lucky their friends and family will do a duty call once in awhile. The staff comes and goes so you don't want to get too attached to anyone. Fellow residents get sick and die or lose their marbles. All those people and nobody to connect with.

They feel fear. Am I going to end up like her/him?

The food usually isn't very good. They are only served what Dr. Orders and can't even say Piss on it if that's what they want to do. Very little, if any privacy. Everybody looking at your old naked body whether youl like it or not. Some of the staff is very kind, some uncaring. You can't eat, sleep, or bathe when you want to. Can't sleep. Wish I could watch TV till I conk out. Ah, no; you're roommate (who drives you nuts) is sleeping.",Negative,
"When I visit nursing homes, especially those which cater to the less affluent, I feel a sort of revulsion. The smells, the sounds, the droopy heads bobbing on chests, the wheelchairs all over the place. It isn’t pretty. I’m repulsed by how our elderly end up living - if you can call it that. So very sad that we, of all nations, cannot figure out how to deal with old age with compassion and community.

I am not criticizing those who are caring and compassionate workers in these facilities (I know some are!) and who do for our elderly what we cannot, or will not, do. I also realize there are circumstances that at times require care facilities, but compared to other countries, I don’t think we’ve got anything to hold our heads up about in this department.

Of course, if you’ve got money to burn . . . that’s another story. I’ve been in some very posh centers where there is a high level of cleanliness, care, and comfort. These are like old age resorts or country clubs. In the best facilities the residents may die of loneliness, but they will not die of neglect.",Negative,
"They told me that they observed the biggest source of unhappiness and bitterness in most of the residents’ lives was disappointment in their children, including that the children never visited, and that because they had no children to be bitter about, they didn’t have that worry. I told this couple that I didn’t think I wanted to have children but worried if I would regret it. They both assured me they never regretted it, with twinkling eyes and loving looks to each other. Of course, another reason they could be happy is that they were there together and had a happy marriage— neither was alone. I suspect they were the type of couple who, when one passes, the other passes not too long after.

I did in fact choose not to have children, and now I am over 60yo and do not regret it. I’m in a happy marriage of 22+ years— after a number of unhappy relationships earlier in life I figured out how to make a better choice for me and I did a lot of therapy over the years to learn to function better after my dysfunctional childhood. It was the right choice for me and for my partner, neither of us have the temperament, not to mention all the other good reasons which include there being plenty of humans already on the planet.",Positive,
"Thanks for the A2A.
I have appeared for GATE three times, once with my final year of B.Tech in 2013 and once with my Job in 2014 and latest when I was teaching at my own company Kreatryx when I got AIR-1 in 2018. Let me tell about both those attempts.

With y B.Tech I was very much worried about the placements as ours was the first batch at IIT Indore and we really had not very high hopes of getting placed so I started to prepare for GATE. We were a group of 3–4 people preparing for GATE and I did not have much idea about which coaching is best and what books to refer and all. Moreover, we lived far away from the city so we could not travel for classes so I thought I would prepare self through Standard Books. So, I started to prepare after my 6th Semester. That time I did not a=have much idea even about syllabus so I prepared one subject which might help me in placements but was not a part of GATE course during summer vacations. As per me that is best time to prepare for GATE due to no pressure of college studies.

Then I took up standard books and marked the topics mentioned in GATE syllabus and studied those from books. For problem solving I bought question bank from market. Then during summer vacations I prepared 1–2 subjects for GATE which needed more focus. Then during 7th semester I used to dedicate after college hours to GATE preparation in which I would study one chapter from Standard Book and solve problems based on that and side by side I kept writing down formulas and important concepts to create short notes. That way I covered most of the course by November. Then in December I got placed in CMC from campus so I returned home to prepare for GATE and during that time I used to devote my entire day for GATE preparation. So, I was able to cover my course by Dec end.

In 8th semester the problem was revision so I could not figure out a better way to revise than to give mock tests so that I could solve all the subjects in one go. So, daily I used to give one mock test and I even solved previous year GATE questions as year wise mock tests and this really taught me time management as well as some useful concepts.
This way I scored 84/100 marks and got AIR-8. But still I went for private sector job as my interest was to work with latest technologies but soon it became clear to me that it is all a myth and work is same in all industries. Then I thought I would rather work in public sector and so I started preparing for GATE 2014 from month of September or so.

My notes were already with me which I used for revision and focused more on problem solving and I had not lost touch with concepts as during the month before September I was teaching as well as I was working part time as content developer. So, I solved question banks in office and solved test series at home each day to better my rank from 8 to 1 but as fate would have I dropped the idea of public sector again and started my own venture Kreatryx.

This was my schedule during both years and I used to dedicate whatever time I had for studies as I always thought of it as my life depended on GATE result.
I sincerely hope that you get something out of my experience.",Positive,
"My answer is pertaining to the struggles of a dropper when Made Easy’s classes for Computer Science were being held at Ber Sarai, opposite Jawahar Lal Nehru University’s old campus. The classes have now completely shifted to Saket, around 6 kms away.

I think, the first and foremost, of course is the mental pressure that comes with dropping. A lot of the people I knew had left lucrative jobs and placement offers to come prepare for GATE. So a lot was counting on the exam for them. It feels like you only have one chance in life, and that is this upcoming GATE exam in February. This of course, sounds delusional in hindsight, but when you are in the heat of the moment, you cannot help but have these thoughts. You thought you would be financially independent once and for all when you become an engineer, but as fate would have it, your father has to empty his pockets again, so you can compete with one lakh other people sailing in the same boat.

Second comes the social pressure, not only on you but your family as well. Most of the non-technical uncles and aunts have never heard of this exam called GATE. When you or your parents tell them you finished your BTech and are now preparing for GATE, they literally have no clue. They will begin badmouthing you in your social circles and this can let a lot of negativity creep in within you, but only if you let it. A lot of people would definitely understand you are preparing for entrance into Masters’ but the very next moment, some of them would point out how a masters don’t mean a dime in today’s world. And you will just have to node in agreement, short of words and reasons to defend how you are still jobless despite having finished your engineering.",Negative,
"While you are dropping for the first time, there are people who sat in the same classroom last year, and the year before, and even the year before that. They will perform exceptionally well in the class. While you have barely opened the cap of your pen, these folks are ready with the answer the teacher posted 3 seconds ago correct to 17 decimal places. You will be astounded by how good they are. If you begin to take this too seriously, you will be digging your own grave. It is important to note that you are in the classroom to add on to your existing knowledge and not to compete with the rest. The competing part will come a few months down the line. Run your own race.

Apart from that, pressure to perform increases exponentially in the final months. You will notice your peers relentlessly giving tests and scoring heavily in them, while you are still stuck revising. When you do start giving tests, you realize, you are easily being outdone by the rest. This adds on to the mental pressure and on to everything mentioned prior to this in the answer. If only you can stay cool and stop comparing yourself to the rest of the folks, you will really surprise yourself at the end of it all.",Negative,
"Some of the common reasons are,

lack of subject knowledge
lack of problem solving skills
lack of practice of numericals
wastage of engineering college life
understanding the gravity of weightage of GATE have at the very last moment
lack of serious level preparation
wearing out after getting a job in campus interview
afraid of being labelled as a failure, if you didn’t perform well as Sharma Ji’s son.
Have trust in yourself and prepare sincerely. You can clear the exam with a good score.",Negative,
"In my case, the hardest time in my GATE preparation was during December.

I just started taking mock tests and for the first 3 tests, I could not cross 50 marks and in the same tests, some people scored more than 80, even 90. This made me think that may be I didn't make the right decision; I should have joined that MNC. My friends used to post pictures on social media, travelling places, enjoying life. But, somehow I kept on going. I used to talk to my mom whenever I used to score less or felt low.

The problem with mock tests or full length tests is that I didn't have the habit of sitting at a single place with full concentration for 3 long hours. It was really difficult at first but it became better as I took more tests.

This December month, for any GATE aspirant, is really important. You score good, your confidence shoots up; you score bad, your confidence goes down. A lot of potential candidates quit at this stage. So make the best out of it.

You know, how important the 19th over in a T20 match is, right? December is the 19th over.",Positive,
